# Hi, I'm Loki.

I am an Electrical Engineer specializing in **electromagnetic design** and **control systems**. 

My work focuses on bridging the gap between simulation and physical implementation. I spend most of my time modeling linear motors, analyzing power systems, and trying to get MATLAB to do what I actually want it to do.

### 🔭 Current Focus: Linear Motion Control
I am currently designing and modeling a **Permanent Magnet Linear Synchronous Motor (PMLSM)**. 
*   **The Goal:** High-precision control for linear drive systems.
*   **The Stack:** Finite Element Method Magnetics (FEMM) for field analysis, coupled with MATLAB/Simulink for dynamic control loops.

### ⚡ Off the Clock
When I'm not calculating magnetic flux density, I write poetry. I find that engineering gives me the structure I need, and writing gives me the chaos I enjoy.
