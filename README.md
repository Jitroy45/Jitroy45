# Loki | Electrical Engineer

Specializing in Electromagnetic Fields, Drive Systems, and Power Simulation.

### 🔬 Research & Development
My primary interest lies in the intersection of **magnetic field theory** and **practical automation**. I am currently developing a **Permanent Magnet Rotor Linear Synchronous Motor (PMRLSM)**.

**Project Highlights:**
- **electromagnetic Design:** Utilizing FEMM to optimize magnet array configurations for maximum thrust density.
- **Dynamic Simulation:** Built a full-system model in Simulink to test PID and AI-driven control strategies before hardware implementation.
- **Renewable Integration:** Analyzing PV system performance using Python (PVlib) to model real-world energy yields.

### 💻 Stack
*   **Languages:** MATLAB, Python, C/C++
*   **Simulation:** Simulink, FEMM, PSpice
*   **Hardware:** Microcontrollers, IoT Modules, Relay Protection Systems
